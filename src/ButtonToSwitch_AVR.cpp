  * @brief	: Source file for the ButtonToSwitch_AVR library classes
  *
  * @details The library implements classes that model several switch mechanisms
  * replacements out of simple push buttons or similar equivalent digital signal 
  * inputs.
  * By using just a button (a.k.a. momentary switches or momentary push buttons,
  * _**MPB**_ for short from here on) the classes implemented in this library will 
  * manage, calculate and update several parameters to **generate the embedded 
  * behavior of standard electromechanical switches**.
  *
  * @author	: Gabriel D. Goldman
  * @version v4.0.0
  * @date	: Created on: 10/09/2024
  * 		: Last modification: 10/09/2024
  * @copyright GPL-3.0 license
  *
  ******************************************************************************
  * @attention	This library was developed as part of the refactoring process for
  * an industrial machines security enforcement and productivity control
  * (hardware & firmware update). As such every class included complies **AT LEAST**
  * with the provision of the attributes and methods to make the hardware & firmware
  * replacement transparent to the controlled machines. Generic use attribute and
  * methods were added to extend the usability to other projects and application
  * environments, but no fitness nor completeness of those are given but for the
  * intended refactoring project.
  * 
  * @warning **Use of this library is under your own responsibility**
